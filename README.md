# Johnny's Mastermind Game - ReadMe

# Title:

Mastermind

# Description

Mastermind is a code guessing game, where a secret four coloured code is randomly generated and the player is tasked to guess the secret code.

The player will have ten attempts to guess the code, in which up to four white/black/no coloured pegs will appear after each submission.
The black peg denotes a colour is correct and location is correct;
white peg denotes a colour is correct and the location is incorrect;
or
no colour peg denotes a colour is incorrect

Note that location of the pegs do not denote the location of a colour choice eg the second peg represents the second location in the sequence

Upon four black pegs, the secret code would be revealed and the player will win the game.
Failure to guess correct secret code after ten attempts, secret code will be revealed and the player will lose the game.
